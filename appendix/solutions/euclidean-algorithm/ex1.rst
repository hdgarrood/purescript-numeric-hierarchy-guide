Exercise 9.1
============

We want to find the greatest common divisor of :math:`a = 1938` and :math:`b =
782`. We start by dividing :math:`1938` by :math:`782`:

.. math::
  1938 = 2 * 782 + 374

And now we divide :math:`798` by the remainder, :math:`374`:

.. math::
  782 = 2 * 374 + 34

Then we divide :math:`374` by our new remainder, :math:`34`:

.. math::
  374 = 11 * 34

This time, it goes exactly. So the greatest common divisor is :math:`34`.
