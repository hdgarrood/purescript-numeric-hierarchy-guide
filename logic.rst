Logic
=====

We will start with a short discussion of logic, in particular we will briefly
cover some notation and a few proof techniques. We will need these later on to
be able to make sense of statements concerning things like rings and fields,
and also to prove or disprove these statements.

You will probably be happy with the idea that statements such as "the sky is
blue" and "pigs can fly" can have truth-values (i.e. "true" or "false"). There
are also ways of combining statements to make new statements, which again you
are most likely familiar with already:

* If you have two statements :math:`P` and :math:`Q`, you can make a new
  statement :math:`P \text{ and } Q`, which is true if both :math:`P` and
  :math:`Q` are true. This is often written as :math:`P \land Q`.
* Similarly, you can also make a new statement :math:`P \text{ or } Q`, which
  is true if at least one of :math:`P` and :math:`Q` are true. This is often
  written as :math:`P \lor Q`.

So for example, if we let the symbol :math:`P` represent the statement "the sky
is blue", and let the symbol :math:`Q` represent the statement "pigs can fly",
the statement :math:`P \lor Q` is true, because at least one of them, in this
case :math:`P`, is true.

**Exercise 1.1.** Using the same assignment of the symbols :math:`P` and
:math:`Q`, what is the truth-value of the statement :math:`P \land Q`?

Truth tables
------------

We can describe the behaviour of logical operators like :math:`\land` and
:math:`\lor` using things called *truth tables*. For example, here is the truth
table for logical and (:math:`\land`):

========= ========= =================
:math:`P` :math:`Q` :math:`P \land Q`
========= ========= =================
T         T         T
T         F         F
F         T         F
F         F         F
========= ========= =================

The table lists the four possible combinations of truth-values of :math:`P` and
:math:`Q`, as well as the truth-value of :math:`P \land Q` in each case. If
this isn't clear, it might help to compare it to an implementation of
:math:`\land` in PureScript::

   logicalAnd :: Boolean -> Boolean -> Boolean
   logicalAnd true true = true
   logicalAnd true false = false
   logicalAnd false true = false
   logicalAnd false false = false

**Exercise 1.2.** Write out the truth table for logical or, :math:`\lor`.

Logical equivalence
-------------------

We say that two statements are *logically equivalent* if they are either both
true or both false. Here is a truth table for logical equivalence with some
entries missing:

========= ========= ===========================
:math:`P` :math:`Q` :math:`P \Leftrightarrow Q`
========= ========= ===========================
T         T         T
T         F         F
F         T         ?
F         F         ?
========= ========= ===========================

**Exercise 1.3.** Complete the missing entries of this truth table.

So for example, :math:`P \land P` is always logically equivalent to :math:`P`,
regardless of the truth-value of :math:`P`. We can express this in symbols by
using a double-ended arrow like this: :math:`P \land P \Leftrightarrow P`.

Logical negation
----------------

Another thing we can do with statements is *negate* them: make a new statement
which is true if the original statement is false, and false if the original
statement is true. If :math:`P` is a statement, then the logical negation of
:math:`P` is written as :math:`\neg P`.

The following two equivalences hold regardless of the truth-values of :math:`P`
and :math:`Q`:

.. math::

  \neg (P \land Q) \; \Leftrightarrow \; \neg P \lor \neg Q

  \neg (P \lor Q) \; \Leftrightarrow \; \neg P \land \neg Q

These two equivalences are called *De Morgan's laws.*

**Exercise 1.4.** Persuade yourself that De Morgan's laws are correct.
One way to do this is to write out a truth table.

Logical implication
-------------------

We now consider statements of the form "if :math:`P`, then :math:`Q`". This way
of connecting logical statements is called *logical implication.* Another way
of saying the same thing is ":math:`P` *implies* :math:`Q`". The symbol for
logical implication is an arrow: we can write the above statement as ":math:`P
\Rightarrow Q`".

:math:`P \Rightarrow Q` is a logical statement just like all of the others we
have seen, and therefore it has a truth-value which depends on the truth-values
of :math:`P` and :math:`Q`. Here is the truth table for logical implication:

========= ========= =======================
:math:`P` :math:`Q` :math:`P \Rightarrow Q`
========= ========= =======================
T         T         T
T         F         F
F         T         T
F         F         T
========= ========= =======================

This might not match up exactly with your intuition: specifically, you might
expect :math:`P \Rightarrow Q` to be false if :math:`P` is false. If this
bothers you, try not to worry about it too much. We will later see that it is
convenient to define logical implication in this way.

**Exercise 1.5.** Persuade yourself, by using a truth table (or any other
method that works for you), that :math:`P \Rightarrow Q` is always logically
equivalent to :math:`\neg P \lor Q` regardless of the truth-values of :math:`P`
and :math:`Q`.

The standard way of proving a statement of the form :math:`P \Rightarrow Q` is
to first assume that :math:`P` is true, and then show that :math:`Q` follows,
i.e. show that :math:`Q` must also be true.

For example, suppose we wanted to prove the statement

.. math::

  x \text{ is even} \Rightarrow x^2 \text{ is even}.
  
We would start by letting :math:`x` be some arbitrary integer and assuming that
it is even. Since :math:`x` is even, we can write :math:`x = 2m` for some
integer :math:`m`. Then, :math:`x^2 = 4m^2` and therefore we have shown
:math:`x^2` has :math:`4` as a factor, so it must also have :math:`2` as a
factor, which means it must be even.

**Exercise 1.6.** Persuade yourself that :math:`P
\Rightarrow Q` is always logically equivalent to :math:`\neg Q \Rightarrow \neg
P`.

This exercise suggests another way of proving statements of the form :math:`P
\Rightarrow Q`, which is to instead assume that :math:`\neg Q` is true, and
show that :math:`\neg P` follows. This technique is called *contraposition;*
the new statement is called the *contrapositive* of the original one.

**Exercise 1.7.** Use contraposition to prove the statement

.. math::

  x^2 \text{ is odd} \Rightarrow x \text{ is odd}.

Another way of thinking of logical equivalence is in terms of logical
implication. Specifically, an alternative way of defining
:math:`\Leftrightarrow` is by saying that :math:`P \Leftrightarrow Q` is the
same as this bad boy:

.. math::

   (P \Rightarrow Q) \land (Q \Rightarrow P)

In fact, the standard way of proving a statement of the form :math:`P
\Leftrightarrow Q` is to prove :math:`P \Rightarrow Q` or
:math:`Q \Rightarrow P`.

Sets
----

For our purposes, it will be sufficient to say a set is a collection of any
kind of mathematical object: sets may contain numbers, functions, sets of
numbers, and so on.

We can write a set by listing the elements in between curly braces, like this:

.. math::

  \{1, 2, 3\}

Note that sets have no concept of ordering, so the set :math:`\{1, 3, 2\}` is
the same as the set :math:`\{1, 2, 3\}`.

The only thing we can really do with a set is to ask whether it contains some
particular thing. The notation for the statement ":math:`a` exists within the
set :math:`A`" looks like this:

.. math::
  a \in A.

We also have a notation for the negation of this statement, i.e. ":math:`a`
does not exist within the set :math:`A`":

.. math::
  a \notin A.

Often (but not always), uppercase letters denote sets, and lowercase letters
denote elements of sets.

Here are a few sets you may have come across already:

* The set of *natural numbers,* :math:`\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ...\}`. That is, the
  set of all the integers which are not negative. This set comes up fairly
  often so we have a special notation for it: :math:`\mathbb{N}`. (Note:
  depending on context, :math:`0` is sometimes not considered to be an element
  of :math:`\mathbb{N}`; in this guide we will say that it is.)

* The set of *integers,* :math:`\{0, 1, -1, 2, -2, 3, -3, ...\}`. Like
  :math:`\mathbb{N}` but it also includes negative numbers. We have a special
  notation for this set too: :math:`\mathbb{Z}`, from the German *Zahlen,*
  meaning "numbers".

* The set of *real numbers,* which is the kind of number you're probably most
  used to. :math:`0, 1, 37, \frac{1}{2}`, and :math:`\pi` are all examples of
  real numbers. This set also has a special notation: :math:`\mathbb{R}`.

So for example, the following are all true:

.. math::

  6 \in \mathbb{N}

  \frac{2}{3} \in \mathbb{R}


  \frac{2}{3} \notin \mathbb{N}.

Quantifiers
-----------

Up to now, the symbols :math:`P` and :math:`Q` have always represented
statements. However we can also use symbols to represent *predicates*, which
are like functions which return statements. For example, we might have a
predicate ":math:`x` is even", ":math:`x` is divisible by 6", or ":math:`x` is
prime".

If we let :math:`P(x)` represent the predicate ":math:`x` is even", then we can
write the statement "2 is even" as :math:`P(2)`. Similarly we can
write the statement "3 is even" as :math:`P(3)`. In each case we get a
statement whose truth-value can depend on the specific value of :math:`x` which
was chosen â€” in this case, the first statement is true but the second is
false.

If we have a predicate, we can make statements about the truth-values of a
predicate over all the possible values it can take as arguments by using things
called *quantifiers*.

The first quantifier we will introduce is called "for all", written as an
upside-down capital letter A like this: :math:`\forall`. Here is how we write the
statement "the square of any real number is greater than or equal to 0" using
the :math:`\forall` quantifier:

.. math::

  \forall x \in \mathbb{R}.\; x^2 \geq 0

This can be read as: "For all :math:`x` in :math:`\mathbb{R}`, :math:`x`
squared is greater than or equal to :math:`0`."

The standard way of proving a statement like this is more or less what you
might expect: we have to show that every element of the set satisfies the
predicate. If the set is finite, we can do this by checking each element
individually. However, we often deal with infinite sets, and anyway individual
checking quickly gets very tedious for even fairly small sets.  Therefore, we
will usually prove statements of this kind by constructing an argument which
deals with every single element of the set *at the same time.* In fact, we have
already seen an example of such a proof: the proof that :math:`x` being even
implies that :math:`x^2` is also even, from a moment ago.

The other quantifier we will use is written as a back-to-front capital letter
E, like this: :math:`\exists`, and can be read as "there exists". Here is how
we would write the statement "there exists a real number whose square is 4" in
mathematical notation:

.. math::

  \exists x \in \mathbb{R}.\; x^2 = 4

There are two possible values of :math:`x` which you can use as examples to
show that this statement is true: :math:`2` and :math:`-2`. In fact, the
standard way of proving a statement of the form :math:`\exists x. P(x)` is to
pick a specific value of :math:`x` and demonstrate that :math:`P(x)` is true
for that :math:`x` (again, as you might expect).

**Exercise 1.8.** Prove the statement :math:`\exists x \in \mathbb{R}.\; 3x + 4
= 13` by finding a suitable value for :math:`x`.

The last thing we need to know in this section is how to negate statements that
contain quantifiers. Here goes:

* The negation of the statement :math:`\forall x. P(x)` is :math:`\exists x.
  \neg P(x)`.
* The negation of the statement :math:`\exists x. P(x)` is :math:`\forall x.
  \neg P(x)`.

This is all rather pleasingly symmetric, isn't it? Try to make sense of these
two rules if you can; they will be useful later. Hopefully if you think about
them for a bit you'll be able to persuade yourself intuitively why they are
true.

**Exercise 1.9.** Show that the statement :math:`\forall x \in \mathbb{R}.\;
x < x^2` is false by finding a *counterexample* â€” that is, a value of
:math:`x` such that :math:`x < x^2` does not hold. Do you see how we are using
the first of the above two rules for negating statements with quantifiers here?
